Project description title format: __[\<Nickname> - Study - \<Platform>]__

As you may have known, the original project I wrote was [Jungle - Study - Java]. It was aimed to train myself to see if or not I could generalise what I have learnt in the past of three years of studying Java.

Like I said, __\[Jungle - Study - Java]__ was a tool used in life to somehow improve my accessibility(pl.) to all tools I might use during processes of studying. Like a tool set, you know.

Here, I'm going to try to have another purpose-aimed project which I declaim here, used to fully improve my abilities to C and, as well my general mindset towards all accessories of all programming languages. I shall be here, no more to say.
